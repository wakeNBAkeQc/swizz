# Secret Map

This small website displays an interactive map using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
Users can save their name, age and gender in the profile page and place a single pin on
the map. All data is persisted in Firebase Firestore so it remains available even
after a refresh or on another device.

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to fetch the local dependencies.
You can then start a local server with `npm start` and open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to get started.
